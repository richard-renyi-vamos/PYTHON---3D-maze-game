3D Maze Game in Python


R
► create a simple 3D maze game in PYTHON.

► I should be able to control a FPV character in a maze.

► Focus on WORKING CODE, nothing fancy is needed, but it should run properly (controllable with WASD and arrows)

Edit
Certainly! I'll create a simple 3D maze game in Python using the Ursina engine, which makes it easier to create 3D games. This code will create a basic maze with walls, a player character that can be controlled with WASD or arrow keys, and a first-person view. Here's the code:

python

Copy
from ursina import *
from ursina.prefabs.first_person_controller import FirstPersonController

app = Ursina()

# Create a simple maze layout
maze = [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,1,0,1],
    [1,1,1,0,1,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
]

# Create wall and floor textures
wall_texture = load_texture('brick')
floor_texture = load_texture('grass')

# Create walls and floor
for i in range(len(maze)):
    for j in range(len(maze[i])):
        if maze[i][j] == 1:
            wall = Entity(model='cube', texture=wall_texture,
                          position=(j,0.5,i), scale=(1,1,1), collider='box')
        else:
            floor = Entity(model='plane', texture=floor_texture,
                           position=(j,0,i), scale=(1,1), collider='mesh')

# Create player
player = FirstPersonController(position=(1,1,1), speed=3)

# Run the game
app.run()
To run this code, you'll need to install the Ursina engine first. You can do this by running:


Copy
pip install ursina
This code creates a simple 3D maze game with the following features:

A 7x7 maze layout defined by a 2D list.
Walls and floors created based on the maze layout.
A first-person player character that can be controlled with WASD or arrow keys.
Basic textures for walls (brick) and floor (grass).
To play the game:

Use WASD or arrow keys to move.
Use the mouse to look around.
Press Esc to exit the game.
Note that this is a basic implementation. The textures used ('brick' and 'grass') are default textures provided by Ursina. If you want to use custom textures, you'll need to add your own image files and update the load_texture() calls accordingly.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code or suggest any improvements?
